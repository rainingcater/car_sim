Packet to Published Message Example

Copyright 2017, Beijing Nuogeng

This is an example to create a ROS driver that reads and decodes the SNAV_BIN packets (gpfpd, gtimu, nvstd, time) and publishes the information as ROS topics / messages. 

This example has been developed and tested using Ubuntu Linux v16.04 LTS and ROS Lunar. Installation instructions for ROS can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Ubuntu.

If you require any assistance using this code, please email support@nuogeng.com.cn.

Installation, build, device configuration, and execution instructions can be found in the file "Beijing Nuogeng ROS Driver Notes.txt".
